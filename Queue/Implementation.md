# The queue supports the following core operations:

- Enqueue: Inserts an item at the rear of the queue.

- Dequeue: Removes the object from the front of the queue, thereby decrementing queue size by one.

- Peek: Returns the object at the front of the queue without removing it.

- IsEmpty: Tests if the queue is empty or not.

- Size: Returns the total number of elements present in the queue.
