# Asymptotic Notations
- ### Types

We use 3 types of asymptotic notations to represent the growth of any algorithm, as input increases:

1. Big Oh (O)
2. Big Omega (Ω)
3. Big Theta (Θ)

## 1. Big Oh:

Mathematically, if f(n) describes running time of an algorithm; f(n) is O(g(n)) if there exist positive constants c and no $, 
## =>  O ≤ f(n) ≤ c g(n) for all n ≥ no    
[It is used to give upper bound on a function] 

## 2. Big Omega:

Mathematically, if f(n) describes running time of an algorithm; f(n) is Ω(g(n)) if there exist positive constants c and no $, 
## =>  O ≤ c g(n) ≤ f(n) for all n ≥ no    
[It is used to give lower bound on a function] 

## 3. Big Theta:

Mathematically, if f(n) describes running time of an algorithm; f(n) is Θ(g(n)) if there exist positive constants c1, c2 and no $, 
## =>  O ≤ c1 g(n) ≤ f(n) ≤ c2 g(n) for all n ≥ no    
[It is used to define the exact asymptotic behavior of the function]
